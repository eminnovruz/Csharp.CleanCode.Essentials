## What is spaghetti  code?
Spaghetti code, also known as spaghetti programming, is a term used to describe a programming style or a piece of code that is overly complex, tangled, and difficult to understand or maintain. It typically refers to code that lacks structure, has convoluted control flow, and is often characterized by a dense web of interconnected logic and branching.

- Unstructured Flow: Spaghetti code lacks a clear and organized structure. It may have excessive branching, loops, and conditional statements that are difficult to follow.

- Goto Statements: Historically, spaghetti code was often associated with the excessive use of "goto" statements, which allow code execution to jump to arbitrary points in the program. This leads to chaotic control flow.

- Poor Modularity: Spaghetti code tends to be monolithic, with little or no separation of concerns into functions or modules. This makes it challenging to reuse code and challenging to test.

- Lack of Documentation: Spaghetti code often lacks meaningful comments and documentation, making it even more challenging to understand.

- High Complexity: Due to its tangled nature, spaghetti code tends to have high complexity, making it prone to bugs and errors.

- Maintenance Nightmare: Spaghetti code is challenging to maintain over time. As the codebase grows, making changes or adding new features becomes increasingly risky and error-prone.

- Debugging Difficulty: Finding and fixing bugs in spaghetti code can be a time-consuming and frustrating process, as changes in one part of the code can unintentionally affect other parts.

- Refactoring Challenges: Refactoring spaghetti code to make it more structured and maintainable can be a daunting task, often requiring a significant rewrite.

- Modern Practices: Modern programming languages and best practices discourage the use of "goto" statements and emphasize structured programming, modularity, and clean code principles to avoid spaghetti code.

## Some tips for changing sphagetti code into clean code.
## Meaningful Names üëç.
### Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.

```csharp
// Wrong Example
int a = 5; // What is "a" ?

// Correct Example
int numberOfBooks = 10; // So easy to understand what does it represents.
```

## Adding Some Comments üí¨
### Add comments if it is necessary or should be explained.

```csharp
// Bad example
int a = Sum(5, 10); // Sum of 2 integer

// Correct example
int numberOne = 5;
int numberTwo = 10;
int result = Sum(numberOne, numberTwo); // Counting 2 number for specific purpose. 
```
### Write 'Summary' for methods.

```csharp
/// <summary> 
/// The function for adding new student. 
/// </summary>
/// <param name="newStudent">Student, will be added to list of students.</param>
public void AddStudent(Student newStudent)
{
    if (newStudent != null)
    {
        Students.Add(newStudent);
    }
    else
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(newStudent));
    }
}
```

## Formatting üìñ
### Follow readable style of code.

```csharp

if (newStudent != null)
{
Students.Add(newStudent);  // Bad Example
}
else
{
    throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(newStudent)); // Correct One
}

```

## Exception Handling ‚öíÔ∏è
### Handle Exceptions.

```csharp
List<Student> Students = null;

Students.Add(new Student("Kamil", 15, 9)); // Example will be finished with exception

// Correct example
try
{
    Student newStudent = new Student("Kamil", 15, 9);
    Students.Add(newStudent);
}
catch (Exception exception)
{
    Console.WriteLine(exception.Message);
}
```

## Dont repeat yourself (DRY) üîÅ
### Try not to write same codes again and again.

```csharp
// Bad example
int result1 = CalculateSquare(5);
int result2 = CalculateSquare(10);

// Good example
int result1 = CalculateSquare(5);
int result2 = CalculateSquare(10);

int CalculateSquare(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```
## Functions üß©
- Try not to write complex functions.
- Keep functions focused on one thing.

```csharp 
// Code , full of errors and mistakes.
public void CountAndSave(int a, int b, FileStream s)
{
    int z = a + b;
    byte t = Byte.Parse(z.ToString());
    s.Write(t);
    Console.WriteLine("Saved!");
}

// Functions which are focused for one job.
public int Count(int numberOne, int numberTwo)
{
    // Some Codes here...
}

public void SaveNumber(FileStream stream, int number)
{
    // Some Codes again..
}
```
